Development
===========

Unit testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~
To run the bzr-hg testsuite, simply run 'bzr selftest -s bp.hg' or
run 'make check' in the top-level bzr-hg directory.

Unavailable bzrlib API's
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When dealing with things that are only available in newer versions of bzr, 
please mention in what Bazaar version they became available. This makes it 
easy to clean up the code later, e.g.::

	try:
		from bzrlib.revspec import revspec_registry
	except ImportError:
		# Not available in Bazaar < 1.12
	else:
		revspec_registry.register_lazy("hg", "bzrlib.plugins.hg.revspec", 
									   "RevisionSpec_hg")

Coding Style, etc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please refer to HACKING in the Bazaar source distribution.
