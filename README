This plugin provides limited support for fetching revisions from 
Mercurial in Bazaar. It supports reading a sufficient amount of 
data for "bzr viz" to work against Mercurial branches.

This plugin requires recent versions of Bazaar and Mercurial to be 
installed to work.

To install::

  bzr branch lp:bzr-hg ~/.bazaar/plugins/hg

To use:

* Use bzr in folders with Mercurial repositories.  (Readonly commands only.)

* Use ``bzr send --format hg``

* Use ``-r hg:SPEC`` to look up Mercurial native revisions.
