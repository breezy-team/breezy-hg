Semantics in Bazaar that can not be mapped to equivalents in Mercurial and 
will be have to be stowed somewhere else:
- revision ids (revision property?)
- octopus merges (store parents > 2 in revision property and turn them 
				  into ghosts)
- whitespace in commit messages (revision property, fancily encoded?)
- file ids (store 'unusual' file ids in a revision property, bencoded?)
