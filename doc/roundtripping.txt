Semantics in Bazaar that can not be mapped to equivalents in Mercurial and 
will be have to be stowed somewhere else:
- revision ids (revision property?)
- octopus merges (revision property?)
- whitespace in commit messages (revision property, fancily encoded?)
- file ids

Mercurial does support custom revision properties, but it might not be a very good idea to 
stow all this data there, in particular the file ids.
